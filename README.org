Fish-like history autosuggestions in eshell

See [[http://whyarethingsthewaytheyare.com/fishlike-autosuggestions-in-eshell/][my blog post]] for an example.

** Usage
Make sure company-mode is enabled in eshell. You can do this with
~(global-company-mode t)~ or by adding a hook:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'company-mode)
#+end_src

Then set the company backend and frontend:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun setup-company-eshell-autosuggest ()
  (with-eval-after-load 'company
    (setq-local company-backends '(company-eshell-autosuggest))
    (setq-local company-frontends '(company-preview-frontend))))

(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'setup-company-eshell-autosuggest)
#+end_src
